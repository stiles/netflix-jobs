The Role Reporting to the Pan-EMEA Events Lead, the Pan-EMEA Events Manager will play a key role in strategizing, executing and managing a broad spectrum of projects, both external events (PR and Marketing campaigns or B2B), and internal events (employee engagement).

We work with a variety of stakeholders to form a cross functional team that collectively strategize, create, shape, and execute these events, from conception through to delivery. It is end to end project management and also a hands-on role - that will mean jumping in to lead cross-functional project taskforce groups, managing agency pitches, ideating creative show flow, overseeing guest communications, formulating budgets, and much more.

Has demonstrable experience in delivering a variety of event formats for different audiences, and above all has the vision and enthusiasm to continually innovate to take our events to the next level. An independent thinker: whilst excellence in execution is key, more important is someone who can garner a deep understanding of a campaign strategy and determine if an event is, or is not, the right approach and challenge the ROI. This person can take high level context and cut through ambiguity easily - they simplify situations for others and have a strong bias to action when it comes to problem solving. This person will be able to operate as part of a varied group of internal stakeholders and with colleagues at all levels of the organisation. They have experience of collaborating with diverse, geographically-dispersed teams, whose native language may not be English. A+ budget management is essential - They can formulate and reconcile a budget and give visibility into their process Thrives in a fast-paced environment and can comfortably multi-task on projects concurrently to a consistent standard. Flexibility to travel when necessary.

328026813,engineering-manager-big-data-analytics-platform,"Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider with over 260 million paid subscribers in over 190 countries around the world. This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team. Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro , the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling. The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale . Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark. The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark. This is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together. The team works on solving challenging problems at scale that have a huge impact on the Data Platform. The team has PMC members and committers who shape and contribute to open-source projects. Check out some of our talks on Spark. What you will do: Partner to deliver the vision, strategy, and adoption of current and future technologies Form trusting cross-functional partnerships to align many engineering teams and ensure our solutions meet their needs, selflessly prioritizing work beyond the scope of your own domain Build, scale, and grow a team of outstanding engineers, challenge them to bring their best selves to work every day, and deliver industry-leading results in stability, performance, and efficiency Balance smart risks, investment in foundational technical work, paying off tech debt, and incremental improvements to deliver timely results across multiple critical strategies What we are looking for: An experienced engineering leader who can drive a team of amazing and geographically distributed engineers to do their best work while building and maintaining strong partnerships with peers and stakeholders Ability to dive deep as needed to facilitate technical strategy trade-offs and zoom out to understand the big picture to shape the product Experience building and running extremely reliable platform systems supporting high-scale and critical workloads, including running a 24x7 on-call, 99.95 +% availability, fast response and short mean-time-to-restore service Bring rigor to decision making and drive down ambiguity with the right mix of collecting data, seeking input, farming for dissent, and making pilot investments to build understanding or confirm direction Proven track record helping a team deliver timely results on critical priorities against many demands for their time, and partnering with product and engineering management to influence the right areas for investment Experience building and leading software engineering teams with a focus on inclusion and diversity, ensuring that we can attract and retain the best talent from anywhere and that all voices are heard to inform our direction Experience in Orchestration, Spark and/ or Big Data Analytics technologies is not a must, but very desirable A few more things about us: As a team, we come from many different backgrounds and countries, and our fields of education range from the humanities to engineering to computer science and we strive to give people the opportunity to wear different hats, should they choose to. We strongly believe this diversity and agility has helped us build an inclusive and empathetic environment, and we are looking forward to adding your perspective to the mix!

 Data Platform 
  
 Engineering Manager, Big Data Analytics Platform 
 Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider with over 260 million paid subscribers in over 190 countries around the world. This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience.

Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration
The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. 
BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro, the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling.

The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark
The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. 
This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark.
The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark. 
This is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together. The team works on solving challenging problems at scale that have a huge impact on the Data Platform. The team has PMC members and committers who shape and contribute to open-source projects.

 Qualifications <li>JD required and active bar membership in the state of California or New York </li><li>10+ years of legal experience in the entertainment and/or technology industries in a strategic leadership capacity, either through a law firm and/or an in-house role, with subject-matter experience in data science.</li><li>Strong track record demonstrating a collaborative approach, effective communication skills, and excellent legal/business judgment.</li><li>Strategic and creative thinker who thrives in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment, undeterred by ambiguity.</li><li>Demonstrated curiosity and ability to quickly master new areas of technology.</li>

 Location: Los Gatos, CA or US Remote only.

Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 250 million paid memberships in over 190 countries, enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. This scale and experience requires a large engineering organization that collectively works together to give customers the end product they love to use.

Productivity Engineering is the organization tasked with making Netflix engineers more effective by building and supporting the infrastructure to create, build, test, deploy, run, and Observe the Netflix stack. As Netflix grows, so does the complexity behind our engineering systems. Our challenge is deceivingly simple: keep the developer experience amazing even as complexity increases. Our work impacts virtually every engineer at Netflix and enables other platform teams to innovate faster. We are looking for a talented engineering leader to join our team. 

We are seeking a Senior Engineering Manager to lead Netflix’s observability efforts. As the “eyes and ears” of Netflix engineering, this team is responsible for implementing infrastructure and tools to enable visibility into the health of hundreds of applications that power Netflix. Thanks to the critical work of this team, Netflix is able to power a highly available system that rivals the reliability of utilities.

The Observability engineering team consists of three sub-groups: Telemetry, Monitoring, Explore & Troubleshooting. You will need to partner with engineering teams across Netflix to build tools and infrastructure that enable fellow engineers to gather timely and actionable insights to help the Netflix service operate reliably.

Netflix is seeking an experienced content designer to work on Ads.

The Role
At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created, and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 220 million paid members.

We recently launched a new ad-supported tier to offer our members more choice in how they consume their content. Our new tier allows us to attract new members at a lower price point, while also creating a compelling path for advertisers to reach audiences that are deeply immersed.

To help us deliver this compelling experience, we’re looking for a highly ambitious, visionary, and experienced Senior Content Designer who will help shape Netflix’s ads consumer experiences for our users.

Our team’s primary superpower is the ability to design creatively and collaboratively in highly complex environments balancing the needs of our members and our advertisers through rigorous testing, empathy, and expertise.

You’ll be one of the lead designers who crafts these experiences and shapes the future of advertising across our product.  More specifically, you’ll be a critical part of one of the most talented and trailblazing advertising design teams in the world.

More about the Slate Team Our goal in Slate marketing is to drive discovery and strengthen the Netflix brand by connecting and celebrating our titles in innovative ways. Because we leverage the power of our best titles, Slate marketing is an important opportunity to define how we are seen by audiences around the world. Though multi-title spots have existed for decades, we’re not interested in the cookie-cutter, straightforward approach. We’re looking to push creative boundaries and invent new ways of communicating with audiences.

You geek out over advertising and can cite your favorite commercials off the top of your head. You are constantly consuming competitive marketing - not just in single-title entertainment, but also in broader advertising and brand marketing. You’re a fan of entertainment at large, and have a deep knowledge of Netflix’s most culturally relevant titles form the past and present. You can own a room when the time asks for it, and you know when to elevate those around you. You are able to engage, listen and collaborate with different teams to align on campaign goals. You are comfortable operating in the gray, without being given a list of next steps. You keep an eye on Social trends and platform evolution to form an understanding of how to apply social and media analytics to fast-moving campaigns. You are an effective manager in a fast paced, multifaceted environment who can coordinate multiple campaign launches happening at once. You are more interested in a team win than an individual win. Your priority is setting others up for success. If your team members look good, you look good. You understand that learning and improving from experience can be just as valuable as winning. You believe inclusion and diversity are cornerstones of successful marketing teams and successful marketing. You inspire and are inspired. You are a collaborator. You don’t mind asking for help or owning a mistake. You appreciate technology and can collaborate with our world class product team to integrate our multi-title campaigns within the member product experience.

 Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

As we grow our business and teams, we look for people from a wide range of backgrounds to reflect the global nature of our members. It takes diversity of thought, culture, background, and perspective to create a truly global business.

You care deeply about your colleagues and when you hear something like ""people over process"" you don't just get excited about good business outcomes, you also think about the good people outcomes that concept can generate. Because of your natural people-orientation, you have the ability to partner cross-functionally with a broad range of partners.

The Talent Intelligence team serves as a consultative partner on critical talent questions, leveraging external labor market insights to address immediate internal talent priorities. The team works across every function at Netflix; you will be the connective tissue between them all, identifying opportunities for collaboration and driving TA strategies. 

The Role
In this role, you will be responsible for a variety of impactful tasks. 

Firstly, you will serve as a dedicated consultative partner to talent acquisition and business teams in EMEA. You will be asked to think about the concrete and the abstract: how changes in the competitive landscape should inform the way we recruit and retain stunning colleagues. You will be asked to identify future challenges our talent teams should anticipate and to think strategically and creatively about how to best equip our teams to address these challenges. Additionally, you will serve as a strategic thought-partner to the talent acquisition leadership team in order to support the development and roll-out of operating strategies. 

Depending on the day, your work could include using market sizing research to guide recruiting strategies, providing talent density insights to influence location strategy, or partnering with talent acquisition leadership to develop long-term executive engagement strategies.

Secondly, you will be responsible for partnering with the TA team on any executive level hiring across EMEA. The role therefore requires someone who is deeply passionate about the content and entertainment industry and who has the experience of running executive search mandates either within an executive search firm or in-house. An established network within this space would be a great advantage as well.

If given a set amount of time to grasp a new topic, you can determine the right amount of information you need for the task at hand.</li><li>You are data-driven and are able to source, synthesize, and translate disparate forms of data into strategic, actionable insights.</li><li>You are an innovator. When facing a challenge, you think of creative ways you could tackle the problem. You’re equally likely to take a tried and true approach and to test out something entirely new, depending on what best suits the situation.</li><li>You care deeply about your colleagues and when you hear something like ""people over process"" you don't just get excited about good business outcomes, you also think about the good people outcomes that concept can generate. Because of your natural people-orientation, you have the ability to partner cross-functionally with a broad range of partners.</li><li>You live our inclusion value and may even have life experience that has led you down an untraditional but exceptionally enriching path. We care less about how impressive-sounding your background is and more about how impressive you are.

 Client and UI Engineering 
  
 Mobile Engineer 5 - Shared Client Foundations 
 The Team

The Shared Client Foundations team builds shared UI architecture and frameworks which power the Netflix TV, iOS, Android and Web applications on devices ranging from web browsers, mobile phones and tablets, to streaming sticks, cable boxes, Smart TVs and game consoles.

We’re passionate about creating elegantly designed, highly performant UI architectures which empower engineers to build amazing UI experiences used by millions of users across the globe. We partner closely with teams across Netflix to help us deliver solutions which make UI development efficient and enjoyable.

Diverse and inclusive teams are strong teams. We encourage those with varied identities, backgrounds, and experiences to apply. We believe that creating a sense of belonging allows us to be our best selves, which in turn helps us produce our best work. We rely on our unique individual strengths to help each other grow.

We have a distributed team, with some teammates working remotely, and some located in the Los Gatos, CA office. The team is committed to being ‘remote-inclusive’ and believe it’s about the work you do, and the relationships you build. Where you can best do that from is up to you.

The Role

Roles on the team provide an opportunity to explore the unique UI systems architecture challenges presented by the Netflix UI application stacks - balancing the performance constraints of the devices we support with developer-friendly solutions which scale.

This particular role requires knowledge of both iOS and Android stacks. We’re looking for expertise in one of them (either one), to provide technical leadership on that platform. Along with competency in the other. Allowing you to work on implementation across both stacks as project needs arise, while identifying opportunities for leverage across stacks.

We believe strong engineering aptitude transcends stacks, and the opportunity to explore other platforms is a unique aspect of this role.

We’re currently building solutions with Swift on iOS, Kotlin on Android, and TypeScript/JavaScript and React on TV & Web. We use GraphQL as our shared data access technology.

We provide ergonomic solutions for UI engineers to access data, configure applications, create server-driven UIs and optimize performance. We work on client side and server side solutions - wherever a problem takes us. And that’s just scratching the surface.

Many of the projects we take on are broad cross-functional efforts, allowing you to extend beyond our team and engage with teams across the company. We’re a team of peers. Everyone has the opportunity to scope, architect, implement, and support the solutions we deliver.

Some of the things we’re excited to be working on currently:
- Building the ideal cross-platform data access architecture for Netflix applications
- Creating a Server Driven UI architecture which accelerates app experimentation
- Delivering frameworks to optimize feature-flag based UI development

We build tools, workflows, and solutions to make it possible for teams to focus on building great web UIs and applications. We do this through a design system, a dynamic client-side module system, testing infrastructure and automation, and more. For 2024 and beyond, our scope expands further into the client-side world, covering potentially complex topics like framework selection, asset bundling, performance, and observability. 

Our technologies are used by hundreds of engineers, from internal tooling teams, to content production teams, to streaming experience teams. We engage with our users throughout the entire software development experience, seeking to deeply understand their requirements so we can distill them into scalable solutions that are easy and enjoyable to use. Collaboration is core to our identity, and developer happiness is our North Star.  

The team anchors on the human-facing elements of technology. These elements are emphasized in our Culture Memo and are applied to our day-to-day work. Code is just a small slice of this team's impact.
