Whatever their taste, and no matter where they live, we give our 270M+ members access to best-in-class TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games. We are the world’s biggest fans of entertainment, and we’re always looking to give members the thrill of the next great story. It’s an exciting time to join Netflix as we continue to raise the bar and innovate in how we serve our fans and members. About The Team The Marketing Partnerships team collaborates with external partners and internal cross-functional teams to create compelling campaigns, activations, sponsorships, and other innovative solutions. As part of our overall marketing efforts, we partner with admired consumer brands to promote our titles and fuel fandom with creative marketing campaigns that drive outsized conversation. These ‘Brand Partnerships’ allow us to unlock new channels, reward fans, and engage new audiences. Importantly, these partnerships are an opportunity to develop unique ideas that neither brand could do without each other. Examples of the work created by this group can be found here - https://www.netflixmp.com/ About The Role You will lead outreach with potential brand partners to build relationships and gain a deep understanding of their goals, planning process, creative ambition, and core equities. You will negotiate and shape robust partnerships with admired brands in support of Netflix’s most prominent films and series. At the earliest stages of development, you will work cross-functionally with the content, marketing, and legal teams to identify titles that strategically align with the Netflix Brand Partnership approach. You will research and engage with a cross-section of brands to identify potential partners and find meaningful connections between titles, audiences, and partner’s marketing priorities. You will be a part of a multi-disciplinary working team within the Marketing Partnerships function. These working teams consist of a brand partner lead (this role) who leads partner engagement and sets the conditions for a successful partnership; a strategy lead that develops strategic intersections between our title and a brand’s positioning; a creative lead who oversees the campaign development; and a production lead that helps to bring the idea to life. You will be tasked with building mutually beneficial deals, using your judgment, business context, and experience to craft a custom approach. You’ll contribute toward the development of highly creative co-promotional campaigns that increase awareness, interest and conversation for both the partner brand and the title. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to any aspect of our partnerships, from deals to creative ideas, so the ideal candidate will have an entrepreneurial spirit. You will build brand partnership presentations, lead partner discussions and negotiations, and manage partner relationships. You will also work with title marketing, media, publicity, and social teams to integrate partnership campaigns into title marketing plans and look to extend these campaigns across countries and regions should there be an opportunity to do so. This role will be responsible for the overall partner relationship, with a focus on maintaining open communication before, during, and after the execution of a partnership campaign. This role will also be at the forefront of establishing the output of our emerging integrated marketing and sponsorship offerings, which are new to Netflix and come on the back of our Ad-supported tier and our increasing ventures into live entertainment.

Extracting insights from partners and internal marketing teams to develop and steer the strategic & creative vision from beginning through to execution. Writing strategy briefs and building the foundations of a strategic intersection between the brand and the title. Drafting and negotiating deal memos and contractual agreements. Experience working alongside Ad Sales and Consumer Products functions. Development of memos, in English, that can articulate clear thinking to inform and guide major decisions or voice opinions that can be shared publicly within the broader Netflix Marketing Org (and sometimes beyond). Providing guidance and feedback to partner creative agencies and brands. Working closely with internal creative groups as well as external agency partners. Translating our brand/marketing requirements into ideas the partner and ultimately consumer easily understands. Drive successful integration of broader creative content and brand initiatives at Netflix and our strategic partners. Collaboration with cross-functional teams including Creative Marketing, Editorial & Publishing, Content, Creative Production, and Public Relations. REQUIREMENTS: Has 7+ years of experience developing, negotiating, and executing incredibly creative entertainment partnerships or brand campaigns. Experience within a film or TV environment, including working with content teams in early development work for film or series (or both).

 About Netflix
At Netflix, our mission is to entertain the world. Whatever their taste, and no matter where they live, we give our 270M+ members access to best-in-class TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games. We are the world’s biggest fans of entertainment, and we’re always looking to give members the thrill of the next great story. It’s an exciting time to join Netflix as we continue to raise the bar and innovate in how we serve our fans and members.

About The Team
The Marketing Partnerships team collaborates with external partners and internal cross-functional teams to create compelling campaigns, activations, sponsorships, and other innovative solutions. As part of our overall marketing efforts, we partner with admired consumer brands to promote our titles and fuel fandom with creative marketing campaigns that drive outsized conversation. These ‘Brand Partnerships’ allow us to unlock new channels, reward fans, and engage new audiences. Importantly, these partnerships are an opportunity to develop unique ideas that neither brand could do without each other. Examples of the work created by this group can be found here - https://www.netflixmp.com/ 

About The Role
You will lead outreach with potential brand partners to build relationships and gain a deep understanding of their goals, planning process, creative ambition, and core equities. You will negotiate and shape robust partnerships with admired brands in support of Netflix’s most prominent films and series. 
 
At the earliest stages of development, you will work cross-functionally with the content, marketing, and legal teams to identify titles that strategically align with the Netflix Brand Partnership approach. You will research and engage with a cross-section of brands to identify potential partners and find meaningful connections between titles, audiences, and partner’s marketing priorities. 
 
You will be a part of a multi-disciplinary working team within the Marketing Partnerships function. These working teams consist of a brand partner lead (this role) who leads partner engagement and sets the conditions for a successful partnership; a strategy lead that develops strategic intersections between our title and a brand’s positioning; a creative lead who oversees the campaign development; and a production lead that helps to bring the idea to life. You will be tasked with building mutually beneficial deals, using your judgment, business context, and experience to craft a custom approach. You’ll contribute toward the development of highly creative co-promotional campaigns that increase awareness, interest and conversation for both the partner brand and the title. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to any aspect of our partnerships, from deals to creative ideas, so the ideal candidate will have an entrepreneurial spirit. 
 
You will build brand partnership presentations, lead partner discussions and negotiations, and manage partner relationships. You will also work with title marketing, media, publicity, and social teams to integrate partnership campaigns into title marketing plans and look to extend these campaigns across countries and regions should there be an opportunity to do so. This role will be responsible for the overall partner relationship, with a focus on maintaining open communication before, during, and after the execution of a partnership campaign. 

This role will also be at the forefront of establishing the output of our emerging integrated marketing and sponsorship offerings, which are new to Netflix and come on the back of our Ad-supported tier and our increasing ventures into live entertainment. It’s a huge opportunity to be at the forefront of a new Netflix offering, one that not only continues to prove how Netflix is the most innovative entertainment company in the world but also helps to deliver and grow an important new revenue stream for the business.

Invention is part of our DNA at Spry Fox. Whether it’s by designing MMOs that encourage the development of friendships and discourage toxicity or by designing unique puzzle games that promote English language learning, we’re always asking ourselves, “How does this game improve your life?” Spry Fox strives to be a studio that is a pleasure to work for, an important but not dominating part of your life, and recognizes crunch is a negative, counter-productive industry practice — something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it. For over 10 years we’ve been fully remote with Foxes scattered all over the world. To make that work well, we all try to be online and communicative from 10 am to 2 pm PT to ensure that we have enough overlapping work hours with our team; otherwise, our schedules are flexible and fully under our individual control! Now that we’re a part of Netflix, we can do what we love with more support and without having to worry about how to monetize!

 Senior Gameplay Engineer, Spry Fox Game Studio 
 
ABOUT OUR TEAM: 
Our motto is “Make the world a better place,” and we try to do this through the games we make. Invention is part of our DNA at Spry Fox. Whether it’s by designing MMOs that encourage the development of friendships and discourage toxicity or by designing unique puzzle games that promote English language learning, we’re always asking ourselves, “How does this game improve your life?”

Spry Fox strives to be a studio that is a pleasure to work for, an important but not dominating part of your life, and recognizes crunch is a negative, counter-productive industry practice — something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it.

For over 10 years we’ve been fully remote with Foxes scattered all over the world. To make that work well, we all try to be online and communicative from 10 am to 2 pm PT to ensure that we have enough overlapping work hours with our team; otherwise, our schedules are flexible and fully under our individual control!

Now that we’re a part of Netflix, we can do what we love with more support and without having to worry about how to monetize! We’ve always been focused on making thoughtful, original games… now more than ever.

328026813,engineering-manager-big-data-analytics-platform,"Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider with over 260 million paid subscribers in over 190 countries around the world. This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team. Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro , the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling. The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale . Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark. The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark.

 Data Platform 
  
 Engineering Manager, Big Data Analytics Platform 
 Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider with over 260 million paid subscribers in over 190 countries around the world. This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience.

Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration
The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. 
BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro, the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling.

The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark
The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. 
This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark.
The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark. 
This is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together. The team works on solving challenging problems at scale that have a huge impact on the Data Platform. The team has PMC members and committers who shape and contribute to open-source projects.

 Core Engineering 
  
 Director of Product, Developer Platform 
 It’s an amazing time to be joining Netflix as we continue to transform entertainment. We deliver billions of hours of movies and TV shows per month to more than 260 million members in over 190 countries. To entertain the world, we must rapidly build and ship innovative experiences for our members and creators all around the globe.

Our Developer Platform is central to this approach, providing a comprehensive experience across the entire software lifecycle, from development to delivery to operations to maintenance. More than just a set of tools, the platform is designed to streamline the development process, making it more efficient and less burdensome. By evolving with the needs of our developers and business, the platform maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of Netflix engineers, increasing their overall impact.

The Opportunity
We are looking for a Director of Product to drive the evolution of our Developer Platform. Your mission is to offer best-in-class experiences that empower and delight our software engineers, and simplify and accelerate their developer experience. You will lead the overall product vision and strategy for our Developer Platform, managing a team of experienced technical product managers who are responsible for different product domains within the platform. This pivotal role enables Netflix engineers to focus on our core mission: entertaining the world. Your contributions will directly shape the future of development, influencing how we innovate and deliver entertainment to millions worldwide.

Our Developer Platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services encompassing the entire software development lifecycle. These include:

Developer Experience: 
We provide a unified front door, the Netflix Console, for easy software and infrastructure management. This includes product discovery, learning, provisioning workflows, software catalog, inventory management, change campaigns, and core services like search.

Developer Foundations: 
We optimize the inner development loop to keep developers in the flow, with development environments and tools like IDEs, source code management, repository management, project initialization, and CLIs.

Application Development: 
We optimize application development by providing tools, frameworks, and libraries for specific personas and use cases (e.g., backend, frontend), including code authoring, build, test, and debug workflows, build systems, test frameworks, and more.

Continuous Integration & Delivery: 
We ensure safe delivery of changes from commit to production with robust, seamless integration of changes, delivery workflows and pipelines, global deployment orchestration, safe delivery and rollbacks, and fleetwide change orchestration.

Reliability & Resiliency: 
We ensure operational excellence and highly reliable, resilient, scalable systems with incident management and product readiness tools, testing frameworks, automation, reporting & insights, and product infrastructure experimentation (e.g., canaries, shadow traffic, performance testing, failure injection testing, chaos experiments, etc).

Observability: 
We enable rapid issue detection and remediation with telemetry ingestion, storage, and querying of metrics, events, logs, and traces, monitoring and alerting, remediation, system health exploration and troubleshooting, and profiling and diagnostic tools.

Examples of opportunities that you and your PMs might tackle include unifying the developer experience, providing holistic end-to-end workflows, managing more for users through higher levels of abstraction, reducing toil, optimizing cycle times, defining how we measure developer experience and productivity, and ensuring we provide best-in-industry tooling. The scope and impact of these roles is significant. You and your PMs will be responsible for managing a portfolio of products and driving holistic product strategy and prioritization across them.

Product Management is a newer team within Platform Engineering, and we're on a mission to elevate product thinking across the organization. This unique opportunity allows you to shape our product management practices and contribute significantly to our evolution.

You will report to the Director of Development for Internal Studios and work closely with the Internal Studios program management team to execute priority initiatives on behalf of Internal Studios.

An example of a key initiative will be producing prototypes using pieces of technology within the Netflix ecosystem to deliver novel experiences for players, which can then be leveraged for game teams. The successful candidate will have experience managing or leading multiple products through their full lifecycle - from ideation to live service, and have a history of successfully delivering games with a focus on player value with teams of varying sizes. They will have a deep stack of ‘seen that, done that,’ and be able to bring a deep toolkit of solutions yet retain the flexibility to tailor solutions to the team’s requirements. You’ll be joining a leadership team who aspires to create ideal conditions for game developers to do their best work, and work with leaders to prioritize and execute on key projects.

Collaborate - This role will involve collaborating with stakeholders and teams with their own priorities.  Strong communication and collaboration skills will be needed for the candidate to be successful in creating alignment and hitting the goal. Advise - Drawing on the depth of experience from multiple cycles of game development, the successful candidate would be able to spot problem areas from far away, and advise teams and stakeholders on them.  Helping the internal leadership group and development teams assess the risk and take commensurate action is a key value of this position Advocate - As with any large organization, there are many teams with competing priorities.  The successful candidate will be able to internally evaluate whether or not something needs to be prioritized, and then be able to successfully influence other teams to support, even without direct authority.  However, escalation is also warranted for cases where the candidate feels that this is a fight worth fighting.

As a member of this team, you will own the feature set that Edge Proxy provides, comprising everything from low-level networking and incoming request processing to high-level product features directly impacting the customer experience. This role will have a broad impact and will allow you to partner with client teams, product teams, and cloud infrastructure teams. Network Services & Insights Network Services & Insights re-architects the approach to managing and exposing modern cloud networking features, building on top of Netflix’s federated resource management platform. We apply time-tested software principles to develop a network management platform that is user-focused, intent-first, and built-in layers using composable modules with clear schemas and a single responsibility principle. The team connects the dots across other networking teams, products, and features to allow us to ship end-to-end experiences, not org charts. We additionally develop and operate some of Netflix’s largest distributed systems offering topology, health, and performance insights, solutions for the identification & consumption of network resources, and structured network data access. Cloud Networking Cloud Network Engineering owns all aspects of cloud-based networking for services at Netflix. Our goal is to create network architectures that can readily evolve to the needs of our product services and initiatives. We achieve this goal through the development of feature-rich tooling and services that improve network availability, security, and visibility while removing friction for our users. Compute Abstractions At Netflix, every engineer is responsible for building and delivering highly efficient, highly scalable products that meet a variety of business needs. In Compute Abstractions, we believe getting up and running in the cloud quickly should be the easiest step when setting out to solve some of the most interesting and complex problems in streaming today. Whatever your computing needs, GPUs, long-running services, or batch computing over many hours, we take the guesswork out of selection so you can trust you have the power and resources required to get the job done. Compute Runtime Every engineer at Netflix works under the “build it, run it” model and our job is to make it safe, easy, and performant for them to run what they build. We own the host-level foundation for Netflix’s server fleet: the customized base operating system and core services that enable the secure and efficient operation of hosts across Netflix. We build core services that enable the provisioning and operation of large server fleets and own the data plane of our centrally managed container platform, Titus.

Engaging directly with end engineering users to understand their needs and improve their experience. Understanding and solving business needs at scale with high-quality solutions. Leaning into proactiveness and effective communication in pursuit of cross-functional alignment. Success criteria: You thrive in ambiguity; complex and fuzzy requirements are more common than clearly defined customer expectations. You take incremental steps toward solving big problems; test-and-learn approaches work better than heads-down development. You are independent and self-driven; progress is often self-directed by teams & individuals. You’ve read about Netflix’s culture and think you would thrive here.
