As a global company, Netflix’s customers come from diverse backgrounds. And each of these backgrounds allow them to experience joy from Netflix in their own unique way. Ultimately, this joy is rooted in our customers’ ability to trust Netflix. At Netflix, we earn this trust through our actions every day.

With the growth of Netflix consumer products to include new verticals such as Games, Live and Ads, we are evolving our solutions to support the unique needs of additional consumer facing solutions, reflecting unique requirements for transported data and integrations. The Team The Security and Privacy Technical Program Management team is a force multiplier for the security organization; we partner closely with engineering and product teams across Netflix to deliver impactful and scalable security initiatives. We collaborate with leaders inside and outside the organization to align on strategic goals and vision to further the security roadmaps for our partnering teams in a business-driven way. We then work with the right stakeholders to establish and drive initiatives that move the needle on this. The Opportunity You will drive large, at-scale security initiatives across multiple products and central engineering orgs with stakeholders ranging from senior leadership, product managers, engineering managers, and developers. It is a great opportunity to help mature the security posture in the most rapidly growing parts of our business and gain intimate knowledge of Netflix’s products and services. These are highly visible and cross-functional efforts that require technical thought leadership across Netflix’s engineering and product organizations. We are leaning into the “T” (Technical) for this role. By technical, we mean that the ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the overall security domain and the ability to gain a technical understanding of programs across their lifecycle. TPMs must be skilled at both strategy and execution as well as have depth in their technical domain. As we expand from SVOD into Live events, onboard you will lead the Live security and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) prevention programs that are business critical and have a unique set of challenges to navigate through. Both programs are closely related and focus around preserving the high availability of our streaming service. You will be responsible for crafting and executing the overall program.

You will be successful in the role if… You are passionate about leading by influence and advocating for change. You have a demonstrated ability to establish a vision and to execute on it. You have excellent written and verbal communication skills, including clear articulation of business impact and technical constraints tailored to the audience. You are able to triage multiple initiatives to make a judgment to tackle the right problems at the right time. You have an ability to identify gaps in solutions, debate technical approaches and weigh-in on product vs technology tradeoffs. You have familiarity with consumer product security principles and best practices, and have developed and driven security initiatives such as DDoS and fraud prevention, to name a few. A few reasons why we love this work and think you will too: You will have the opportunity to facilitate impactful security work for the Netflix business and engineering ecosystem. You will be working with an industry leading security team with many opportunities to improve existing projects and identify new ones. You will have the opportunity to research new ideas and share them across the community. You enjoy learning and working closely with domain experts in diverse areas such as microservices architecture, data science and engineering, content delivery networks, and a production studio.

 Technical Program Manager (L5) - Consumer Product Security 
 About Netflix
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause, and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.

As a global company, Netflix’s customers come from diverse backgrounds. And each of these backgrounds allow them to experience joy from Netflix in their own unique way. Ultimately, this joy is rooted in our customers’ ability to trust Netflix. At Netflix, we earn this trust through our actions every day. And we work hard to continue to build this trust with our customers throughout the world. With the growth of Netflix consumer products to include new verticals such as Games, Live and Ads, we are evolving our solutions to support the unique needs of additional consumer facing solutions, reflecting unique requirements for transported data and integrations.

The Team
The Security and Privacy Technical Program Management team is a force multiplier for the security organization; we partner closely with engineering and product teams across Netflix to deliver impactful and scalable security initiatives. We collaborate with leaders inside and outside the organization to align on strategic goals and vision to further the security roadmaps for our partnering teams in a business-driven way. We then work with the right stakeholders to establish and drive initiatives that move the needle on this. 

The Opportunity
You will drive large, at-scale security initiatives across multiple products and central engineering orgs with stakeholders ranging from senior leadership, product managers, engineering managers, and developers. It is a great opportunity to help mature the security posture in the most rapidly growing parts of our business and gain intimate knowledge of Netflix’s products and services. These are highly visible and cross-functional efforts that require technical thought leadership across Netflix’s engineering and product organizations. 

We are leaning into the “T” (Technical) for this role. By technical, we mean that the ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the overall security domain and the ability to gain a technical understanding of programs across their lifecycle. TPMs must be skilled at both strategy and execution as well as have depth in their technical domain. 

As we expand from SVOD into Live events, onboard you will lead the Live security and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) prevention programs that are business critical and have a unique set of challenges to navigate through. Both programs are closely related and focus around preserving the high availability of our streaming service. You will be responsible for crafting and executing the overall program. This includes translating the vision into a program strategy, leading critical initiatives, building the technical execution plan, stakeholder management, and overseeing the development of quarterly roadmaps. 
 
 You will be successful in the role if… <li>You are passionate about leading by influence and advocating for change.&nbsp;</li><li>You have a demonstrated ability to establish a vision and to execute on it.</li><li>You have excellent written and verbal communication skills, including clear articulation of business impact and technical constraints tailored to the audience.</li><li>You are able to triage multiple initiatives to make a judgment to tackle the right problems at the right time.</li><li>You have an ability to identify gaps in solutions, debate technical approaches and weigh-in on product vs technology tradeoffs.</li><li>You have familiarity with consumer product security principles and best practices, and have developed and driven security initiatives such as DDoS and fraud prevention, to name a few.&nbsp;</li> 
 A few reasons why we love this work and think you will too: <li>You will have the opportunity to facilitate impactful security work for the Netflix business and engineering ecosystem.</li><li>You will be working with an industry leading security team with many opportunities to improve existing projects and identify new ones.</li><li>You will have the opportunity to research new ideas and share them across the community.</li><li>You enjoy learning and working closely with domain experts in diverse areas such as microservices architecture, data science and engineering, content delivery networks, and a production studio.</li> 
 Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $100,000 - $720,000.

 It’s an amazing time to be joining Netflix as we continue to transform entertainment. We deliver billions of hours of movies and TV shows per month to more than 260 million members in over 190 countries. To entertain the world, we must rapidly build and ship innovative experiences for our members and creators all around the globe.

Our Developer Platform is central to this approach, providing a comprehensive experience across the entire software lifecycle, from development to delivery to operations to maintenance. More than just a set of tools, the platform is designed to streamline the development process, making it more efficient and less burdensome. By evolving with the needs of our developers and business, the platform maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of Netflix engineers, increasing their overall impact.

The Opportunity
We are looking for a Director of Product to drive the evolution of our Developer Platform. Your mission is to offer best-in-class experiences that empower and delight our software engineers, and simplify and accelerate their developer experience.

This pivotal role enables Netflix engineers to focus on our core mission: entertaining the world. Your contributions will directly shape the future of development, influencing how we innovate and deliver entertainment to millions worldwide.

Our Developer Platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services encompassing the entire software development lifecycle. These include:

Developer Experience: 
We provide a unified front door, the Netflix Console, for easy software and infrastructure management. This includes product discovery, learning, provisioning workflows, software catalog, inventory management, change campaigns, and core services like search.

Developer Foundations: 
We optimize the inner development loop to keep developers in the flow, with development environments and tools like IDEs, source code management, repository management, project initialization, and CLIs.

Application Development:

Continuous Integration & Delivery: 
We ensure safe delivery of changes from commit to production with robust, seamless integration of changes, delivery workflows and pipelines, global deployment orchestration, safe delivery and rollbacks, and fleetwide change orchestration.

Reliability & Resiliency: 
We ensure operational excellence and highly reliable, resilient, scalable systems with incident management and product readiness tools, testing frameworks, automation, reporting & insights, and product infrastructure experimentation (e.g., canaries, shadow traffic, performance testing, failure injection testing, chaos experiments, etc).

Observability: 
We enable rapid issue detection and remediation with telemetry ingestion, storage, and querying of metrics, events, logs, and traces, monitoring and alerting, remediation, system health exploration and troubleshooting, and profiling and diagnostic tools.

Examples of opportunities that you and your PMs might tackle include unifying the developer experience, providing holistic end-to-end workflows, managing more for users through higher levels of abstraction, reducing toil, optimizing cycle times, defining how we measure developer experience and productivity, and ensuring we provide best-in-industry tooling. The scope and impact of these roles is significant. You and your PMs will be responsible for managing a portfolio of products and driving holistic product strategy and prioritization across them.

314051036,events-manager-mexico,"The Opportunity Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 247 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time. We are looking for a talented event professional, who will be based in the Bogota office, to join a team that is spearheading promotional campaigns across Latin America. Join us for a chance to strategize, plan and execute events alongside a team that is working on series and films that feature high production value from the brightest filmmakers and actors in the industry, using the latest technology. We need an expert who will understand the different cultures and idiosyncrasies of the markets in the Latin American region. The Team The mission of the Events team is to provide a consistent, high quality experience to all audiences in our events across Latin America in order to fuel fandom for our titles and talent. The Role The SONOLA Events Manager will play a key role in strategizing, executing and managing events in collaboration with the SONOLA Publicity and Marketing teams as well as LatAm Events, working across documentaries, series and films. The role will manage a wide range of events such as red carpet premieres, influencer activations as well as experiential marketing campaigns and digital engagement. The ideal candidate has broad event experience and has worked handling events for film, TV or entertainment brands. They will be able to communicate with filmmakers, talent representatives, agencies, executives and production partners on efforts. They can formulate, oversee and manage a budget, and give visibility into their process successfully. Pack your bag because travel is a requirement. The ideal candidate is able to make wise decisions, even when faced with ambiguity and thinks strategically. This person is curious by nature, an “outside-the-box” thinker with a passion for and understanding of experiential events and someone who is not afraid to shake things up. They can articulate what they are - and are not - trying to do. They are a good listener and a real doer, and are able to multitask and work at a clip pace. Most importantly, they can guide a team to do all of the same and work as autonomous adults. They are organized, thorough and not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that will mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from hiring an agency to plan an event, to maintaining and updating guest lists, to booking a venue themselves for an event or to working a check-in table. We are a small team, so the responsibility is wide-ranging. They collaborate well with partners that range from the publicists to content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style, they are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and question values inconsistent with our values. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they're tactful in handling such issues. Qualifications The successful candidate for Events Manager will have 7+ years of entertainment experience organizing, planning, executing and staffing events at an agency, studio, network or with a brand.

 Events Manager (SONOLA) 
 The Opportunity

Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 247 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films, and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

We are looking for a talented event professional, who will be based in the Bogota office, to join a team that is spearheading promotional campaigns across Latin America. Join us for a chance to strategize, plan and execute events alongside a team that is working on series and films that feature high production value from the brightest filmmakers and actors in the industry, using the latest technology. We need an expert who will understand the different cultures and idiosyncrasies of the markets in the Latin American region. 

The Team
The mission of the Events team is to provide a consistent, high quality experience to all audiences in our events across Latin America in order to fuel fandom for our titles and talent.

 
 The Role <li>The SONOLA Events Manager will play a key role in strategizing, executing and managing events in collaboration with the SONOLA Publicity and Marketing teams as well as LatAm Events, working across documentaries, series and films. The role will manage a wide range of events such as red carpet premieres, influencer activations as well as experiential marketing campaigns and digital engagement.&nbsp;</li><div><br></div><li>The ideal candidate has broad event experience and has worked handling events for film, TV or entertainment brands. They will be able to communicate with filmmakers, talent representatives, agencies, executives and production partners on efforts. They can formulate, oversee and manage a budget, and give visibility into their process successfully. Pack your bag because travel is a requirement.</li><div><br></div><li>The ideal candidate is able to make wise decisions, even when faced with ambiguity and thinks strategically. This person is curious by nature, an “outside-the-box” thinker with a passion for and understanding of experiential events and someone who is not afraid to shake things up. They can articulate what they are - and are not - trying to do. They are a good listener and a real doer, and are able to multitask and work at a clip pace. Most importantly, they can guide a team to do all of the same and work as autonomous adults. They are organized, thorough and not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that will mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from hiring an agency to plan an event, to maintaining and updating guest lists, to booking a venue themselves for an event or to working a check-in table. We are a small team, so the responsibility is wide-ranging.</li><div><br></div><li>They collaborate well with partners that range from the publicists to content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style, they are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and question values inconsistent with our values. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they're tactful in handling such issues.</li><div><br></div> 
 Qualifications <li>The successful candidate for Events Manager will have 7+ years of entertainment experience organizing, planning, executing and staffing events at an agency, studio, network or with a brand. </li><li>They are familiar with a broad range of event productions from red carpet premieres to consumer experiences. </li><li>Of particular interest are candidates with broad knowledge of TV, international publicity, entertainment, pop culture &amp; lifestyle trends, etc. in LATAM.</li><li> BA/BS required.</li><li>Languages: The ability to speak/write in Spanish and English is essential</li>

Personalization permeates almost every aspect of the Netflix product experience: From adapting the UI’s layout to member tastes, recommending the most delightful content, to showing the most helpful title images and trailers to help members choose better - machine learning is essential to how members enjoy our service.

We are looking for a Product manager to both advance our existing personalization capabilities in the member experience and to build new algorithmically powered experiences that will delight our members, with a focus on specific contexts like ranking titles a member has previously interacted with, or recommendations related to a specific context like “More Like This”. 

Leveraging available data, you will craft and communicate a strategic roadmap and see to its execution leading cross-functional teams of the industry’s best data scientists, machine learning and software engineers. You will work in close partnership with the member experience product management team, design, consumer insights and other functions to bring your vision to life and drive transformational change of the product experience. As a high-leverage thought leader, you will have the ability to shape our thinking on how to evolve our product, and have a massive impact on how members enjoy our service. 

This role is based in our Los Gatos office (preferred) in a hybrid model, but we are open to remote candidates who are on the West Coast. Some travel to Los Gatos will be required.

Who will be successful in this role?
You combine a deep technical background in e.g. statistics, econometrics, or machine learning with a strong product sense and excellent communication skills to define, explain and execute your vision. You naturally gravitate towards experimentation as a way to validate your hypotheses while having a healthy skepticism when interpreting experimental results. In order to be successful in this position, you need to be able to work with world-class engineers, have the statistical acumen to collaborate with top-notch data scientists and the business sense to drive product goals and strategies. Demonstrated ability to build successful consumer facing applications and algorithms, and a strong feel for the entertainment business are big pluses.
