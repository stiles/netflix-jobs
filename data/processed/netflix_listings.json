It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team. Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix\u2019s analytics and machine learning needs. BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro , the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling. The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale . Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix\u2019s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark. The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no\/low touch ways to use Spark. This is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together. The team works on solving challenging problems at scale that have a huge impact on the Data Platform. The team has PMC members and committers who shape and contribute to open-source projects. Check out some of our talks on Spark. What you will do: Partner to deliver the vision, strategy, and adoption of current and future technologies Form trusting cross-functional partnerships to align many engineering teams and ensure our solutions meet their needs, selflessly prioritizing work beyond the scope of your own domain Build, scale, and grow a team of outstanding engineers, challenge them to bring their best selves to work every day, and deliver industry-leading results in stability, performance, and efficiency Balance smart risks, investment in foundational technical work, paying off tech debt, and incremental improvements to deliver timely results across multiple critical strategies What we are looking for: An experienced engineering leader who can drive a team of amazing and geographically distributed engineers to do their best work while building and maintaining strong partnerships with peers and stakeholders Ability to dive deep as needed to facilitate technical strategy trade-offs and zoom out to understand the big picture to shape the product Experience building and running extremely reliable platform systems supporting high-scale and critical workloads, including running a 24x7 on-call, 99.95 +% availability, fast response and short mean-time-to-restore service Bring rigor to decision making and drive down ambiguity with the right mix of collecting data, seeking input, farming for dissent, and making pilot investments to build understanding or confirm direction Proven track record helping a team deliver timely results on critical priorities against many demands for their time, and partnering with product and engineering management to influence the right areas for investment Experience building and leading software engineering teams with a focus on inclusion and diversity, ensuring that we can attract and retain the best talent from anywhere and that all voices are heard to inform our direction Experience in Orchestration, Spark and\/ or Big Data Analytics technologies is not a must, but very desirable A few more things about us: As a team, we come from many different backgrounds and countries, and our fields of education range from the humanities to engineering to computer science and we strive to give people the opportunity to wear different hats, should they choose to. We strongly believe this diversity and agility has helped us build an inclusive and empathetic environment, and we are looking forward to adding your perspective to the mix!

You will be responsible for developing the creative strategy that inspires cross-functional teams, drives big thinking and creates cohesion across every touchpoint of a campaign. More about the Slate Team Our goal in Slate marketing is to drive discovery and strengthen the Netflix brand by connecting and celebrating our titles in innovative ways. Because we leverage the power of our best titles, Slate marketing is an important opportunity to define how we are seen by audiences around the world. Though multi-title spots have existed for decades, we\u2019re not interested in the cookie-cutter, straightforward approach. We\u2019re looking to push creative boundaries and invent new ways of communicating with audiences. Therefore, success in this role will require a high degree of comfort operating in the gray, and the best candidates are the ones who are passionate about solving business opportunities creatively, and who can thrive without a clearly defined roadmap to follow. How do I know if I\u2019m a fit for the role? You have a proven track record of leading impactful, world-class creative campaigns that connect with audiences and break through the cultural zeitgeist. You can build a campaign strategy from the ground up.

You geek out over advertising and can cite your favorite commercials off the top of your head.

You\u2019re a fan of entertainment at large, and have a deep knowledge of Netflix\u2019s most culturally relevant titles form the past and present. You can own a room when the time asks for it, and you know when to elevate those around you. You are able to engage, listen and collaborate with different teams to align on campaign goals. You are comfortable operating in the gray, without being given a list of next steps. You keep an eye on Social trends and platform evolution to form an understanding of how to apply social and media analytics to fast-moving campaigns. You are an effective manager in a fast paced, multifaceted environment who can coordinate multiple campaign launches happening at once. You are more interested in a team win than an individual win. Your priority is setting others up for success. If your team members look good, you look good. You understand that learning and improving from experience can be just as valuable as winning. You believe inclusion and diversity are cornerstones of successful marketing teams and successful marketing. You inspire and are inspired. You are a collaborator. You don\u2019t mind asking for help or owning a mistake. You appreciate technology and can collaborate with our world class product team to integrate our multi-title campaigns within the member product experience. You have an entrepreneurial mindset and are eager to flourish in our unique company culture (see Who We Are ). Core Responsibilities Lead multiple slate campaigns simultaneously with a range in scope and scale. Understand the fundamental difference between anticipation, curation and celebration and how to apply those areas strategically when thinking about new slate moments. Create and maintain the strategic platform for slate marketing campaigns, inclusive of positioning, thematic pillars, audience targets, and conversation goals. Oversee the execution of campaign materials (trailers, key art, social, stunts) and media activations, acting as the main point of contact with agencies and external partners. Communicate campaign strategy with key stakeholders and inspire cross-functional alignment to ensure campaign cohesion and consistency. Be on the front lines of every campaign with publicity, social, and content partners. When applicable, serve as a primary contact for filmmakers\/showrunners and talent to communicate slate campaign approach, goals and tactics while delivering a best in class experience to the artists. Manage overall campaign scope, budget and timing, and resources from inception to finishing. Partner with the marketing ops team to ensure campaigns are delivered on time, at scale and on budget.
