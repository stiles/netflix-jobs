We pride ourselves on using data to inform our decision-making as we work towards our mission.

In addition, we require our Data Engineers to have a rich understanding of large distributed systems on which our data solutions rely. Candidates should have knowledge across several of these skill sets and usually need to be deep in at least one.

 Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with 270 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Content Infrastructure & Solutions (CIS) empowers engineers working on content and studio applications to be innovative and agile in supporting our massive global content production needs. We do that by providing scalable and resilient infrastructure to address integrated large-scale media, assets, data, workflow, and communication use cases. Examples of this organization’s work include massive-scale media processing platforms (1, 2), workflows (conductor), and data processing at scale.

The Content MiddleWare Infrastructure team(MWI), a part of the Content Infrastructure & Solutions group, provides Studio and Content Engineering specific, highly leveraged, and fully managed data, workflow, and messaging & communication platforms facilitating the goal of the Connected Studio. To learn more about what the MWI team does, check out the following tech blogs: workflow (1, 2), search (1, 2, 3), data movement (1, 2).

The Media Infrastructure Platform team (MIP) is part of a media-focused engineering group that provides highly available infrastructure for content production and processing, storage, and access, across all Netflix productions and licensed content.

This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team. Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro , the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling. The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale . Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark.

 Data Platform 
  
 Engineering Manager, Big Data Analytics Platform 
 Netflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment provider with over 260 million paid subscribers in over 190 countries around the world. This success has depended on an industry-leading engineering organization building cloud-native services with exceptional scale and resilience.

Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) team is responsible for providing orchestration and compute technologies to ETL and to access nearly 1 ExaByte of data in the Netflix Warehouse. It is also responsible for the underlying table format, Iceberg (an industry standard table format and an open source project that originated in this team), metadata, security and the life-cycle of the data (janitoring, compacting etc). Two Engineering Manager roles are open in the BDAP team.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Orchestration
The Big Data Orchestration (BDO) team provides an opinionated, cost-efficient, reliable, easy-to-use orchestration platform to meet Netflix’s analytics and machine learning needs. 
BDO enables scheduling, orchestrating, and executing big data workflows and jobs. The core of Orchestration is Maestro, the next-generation Data Workflow Orchestration platform to meet Netflix's current and future needs. It is a general-purpose workflow orchestrator that provides a fully managed workflow-as-a-service (WAAS). The team built Maestro from the ground up, enabling high throughput, horizontal scalability, and advanced parametrized, event-based scheduling.

The BDO team is building an ETL framework for incremental data processing for increased data accuracy, freshness, and easy backfill to directly impact the cost and operational efficiency of Analytics and ML. Orchestration is powered by the federated job execution engine, Genie under the hood, which abstracts away query engine specifics from users. The suite of Orchestration products includes sophisticated error classification and intelligent job auto-remediation using Pensive and Nightingale.

Engineering Manager, Big Data Compute Spark
The Big Data Compute Spark (BDCS) team provides high-performance, scalable, distributed data processing at rest with the customized-for-Netflix fork of Apache Spark on Hadoop to meet Netflix’s large scale data analytics and machine learning needs. 
This team of 7 people (and growing) is central to batch data processing and analytics in the Data Platform at Netflix. It provides support for Spark to ETL data into the Exabytes-scale data warehouse and a variety of ways (for casual and power users) to access that data using Spark.
The team is working on integrating Spark accelerators to further drive performance, evaluating containerization platforms to run Spark, building better batch and real time observability into Spark workflows and no/low touch ways to use Spark. 
This is a dream team of highly passionate and intelligent engineers who work well together. The team works on solving challenging problems at scale that have a huge impact on the Data Platform. The team has PMC members and committers who shape and contribute to open-source projects.

The successful candidate will have experience managing or leading multiple products through their full lifecycle - from ideation to live service, and have a history of successfully delivering games with a focus on player value with teams of varying sizes. They will have a deep stack of ‘seen that, done that,’ and be able to bring a deep toolkit of solutions yet retain the flexibility to tailor solutions to the team’s requirements. You’ll be joining a leadership team who aspires to create ideal conditions for game developers to do their best work, and work with leaders to prioritize and execute on key projects.

Collaborate - This role will involve collaborating with stakeholders and teams with their own priorities.  Strong communication and collaboration skills will be needed for the candidate to be successful in creating alignment and hitting the goal. Advise - Drawing on the depth of experience from multiple cycles of game development, the successful candidate would be able to spot problem areas from far away, and advise teams and stakeholders on them.  Helping the internal leadership group and development teams assess the risk and take commensurate action is a key value of this position Advocate - As with any large organization, there are many teams with competing priorities.  The successful candidate will be able to internally evaluate whether or not something needs to be prioritized, and then be able to successfully influence other teams to support, even without direct authority.  However, escalation is also warranted for cases where the candidate feels that this is a fight worth fighting.

 Product Management 
  
 Product Manager, Personalized Experiences 
 The Role
With more than 270 million members in over 190 countries, Netflix continues to shape the future of entertainment around the world. Personalization permeates almost every aspect of the Netflix product experience: From adapting the UI’s layout to member tastes, recommending the most delightful content, to showing the most helpful title images and trailers to help members choose better - machine learning is essential to how members enjoy our service.

We are looking for a Product manager to both advance our personalization in the member experience and to build new algorithmically powered experiences that will delight our members. This PM works across a number of different parts of our product with personalized recommendations. For example, determining which titles and what product features we make available to members after they have completed watching a title. 

Leveraging available data, you will craft and communicate a strategic roadmap and see to its execution leading cross-functional teams of the industry’s best data scientists, consumer insights researchers, designers, machine learning and software engineers. As a high-leverage thought leader, you will have the ability to shape our thinking on how to evolve our product and have a massive impact on how members enjoy our service. 

This role is based in our Los Gatos office (preferred) in a hybrid model, but we are open to remote candidates who are on the West Coast. Travel to Los Gatos will be required if remote-based.

Who will be successful in this role?
You combine a technical background with a strong product sense and excellent communication skills to define, explain and execute your vision. You naturally gravitate towards experimentation as a way to validate your hypotheses while having a healthy skepticism when interpreting experimental results. In order to be successful in this position, you need to be able to work with world-class engineers, have the statistical acumen to collaborate with top-notch data scientists and the business sense to drive product goals and strategies. Demonstrated ability to build successful consumer-facing applications and algorithms, and a strong feel for the entertainment business are big pluses.
